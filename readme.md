# Ambient CRT

I bought an old 90's CRT and I want it to basically play videos on loop in the background.
This hosts a web server on the local network that lets you upload videos and play them on the CRT, on loop, an optionally on mute or with a visualizer.

This is not secured in any way so don't expose it to the internet.

**REQUIRES VLC**
